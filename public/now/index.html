    <p>This is me within a point in time, as best I can summarise myself.</p>

    <article>
      <h2>Me time</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I live in Glasgow, Scotland with my <small>[very]</small> significant other, our dog
          <small>(a Pomeranian)</small>, rabbit, 2 fish and hamster.
          <small>(I've re-written this point far too often because pets pass away too quickly)</small>
        </li>
        <li>
          I bought my first ever comic book recently,
          <a href="https://www.dccomics.com/comics/batman-2016/batman-95" rel="external">
            Batman #95
          </a>
          . I chose this one because I've been playing the Arkham games lately and always wanted to see if I would
          enjoy comics as much as I do the TV/Movies inspired by them.
        </li>
        <li>Watching TV, walking the dog and generally keeping isolated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things to do post-Covid</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.centralstrengthgym.com/" rel="external">
            The gym
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Skating in the form of Roller disco, Roller derby (maybe... see below) and Aggressive inline park skating.
        </li>
        <li>Cinema trips at the weekend</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Further down this page, you'll come across a few pursuits/goals I have for my work and educational areas. Many
        of these are to support the main goal in life right now.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Move to Canada</b> - The driver for much of what I do.
        </li>
        <li>Learn to drive (Currently studying for theory test).</li>
        <li>
          Sort out a better daily routine. Ideally; early wake-up, a nice morning walk, work, lunch-time fitness and
          chilled evenings.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Coding time</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I've been a Software Engineer at
          <a href="https://www.fanduel.com/" rel="external">FanDuel</a>
          for 2+ years. I was promoted to Senior at the beginning of 2020.
        </li>
        <li>
          I mostly work in React and I build a lot of random sites using
          <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" rel="external">Gatsby</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          I build small experimental apps in
          <a href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="external">Flutter</a>.
          <small>(coincidentally FanDuel's parent company is also called Flutter)</small>
        </li>
        <li>I build and manage a lightweight storage system for my friend's Games that I've codenamed Morpus.</li>
        <li>
          My main side project is called Pongstars, it's a mobile app written in Flutter for managing Table Tennis
          leagues <small>(we play a lot at work)</small>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Goals</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Get back to full-stack development.</li>
        <li>Build my partner a portfolio website.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2 id="fitness">Fitness</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.centralstrengthgym.com/" rel="external">
          The gym
        </a>
        was the only reason I managed to hold back the blubber that was my body. I used to be nearly 108kg
        <small>(17st, 237 pounds)</small> and then I took the gym, and my diet, more serious and managed to drop 25kg.
        Now that I'm in lockdown it's all unravelling.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When not in lockdown I went to the gym every weekday on my lunch break (usually around 2 hours).</li>
        <li>
          I also attended training for
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_derby" rel="external">
            Roller Derby
          </a>
          . I'm not very good and I haven't played a proper game yet, and may never as I came to realise I am not at
          all competitive and I just like the training.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>I've significantly toned down my goals because... lockdown.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Walk more.</li>
        <li>Try to get into the habit of doing some stretch work to counter all the sitting.</li>
      </ul>
