# Elements

Elements are the basic building blocks of the website, they are very light wrappers around standard HTML elements and add just a little bit of extra control over how things are rendered and styled.

Check out the other stories here for all the basic Elements defined for this project, then [check out the Typography](?path=/story/elements-typography--default) story to see how it all comes together.
