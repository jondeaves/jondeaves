        My desk setup at the moment is very much in flux as we work through our shipment of belongings from the UK, so I

            <li>
              I have a monitor and speakers on the desktop so the length is great to ensure things aren&apos;t too cramped

              This chair is fantastic for my lower back, picked it up from a

              Picked up a 2-pack of these smart lights and mounted them to the

            </li>
            <li>
              Includes a built-in USB hub which means when I switch between the
              USB-C/DisplayPort inputs then the Keyboard, Mouse, Webcam and
              Microphone all switch over too
            </li>
            <li>
              The physical size is nice because the older I get the larger I

              The speakers have good quality audio and multiple input sources

              Paired with the{" "}
