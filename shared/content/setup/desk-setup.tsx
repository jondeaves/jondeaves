        My desk setup at the moment is very temporary as I await the bulk of my
        belongings getting shipped out to us, so I will explain the most recent
        configuration before our move. To start with{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="/desk.jpg" label="here is a photo" /> showing the
        most recent desk setup that I could find.
      </p>

      <p>The majority of my physical setup is as follows;</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Desk &mdash;{" "}

          />
          <ul>
            <li>
              The hand crank can get a little annoying so I don&apos;t switch
              positions much but still a great price for a sit/stand
            </li>
            <li>
              The size was great as it lined up pretty perfectly with the space
              I had available and gave me lots of desktop area to work with
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Chair &mdash;{" "}

          />
          <ul>
            <li>
              This chair is fantastic for my lower back, picked it up from a
              refurbished reseller
            </li>
            <li>
              Upgraded the wheels to these{" "}

            </li>
          </ul>

          Lighting &mdash;{" "}

          />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Picked up a 2-pack of these smart lights and mounted them to the
              back of the monitor to provide some balanced light
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitor &mdash;{" "}

          <ul>
            <li>
              Provides USB-C and DisplayPort which lets me connect it to my work
              laptop and my PC
            </li>
            <li>
              Includes a built-in USB hub which means when I switch between the
              USB-C/DisplayPort inputs then the Keyboard, Mouse, Webcam and
              Microphone all switch over too
            </li>
            <li>
              The physical size is nice because the older I get the larger I
              need the text to appear
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              These were larger than I expected as I was looking for something
              low-profile
            </li>
            <li>
              The speakers have good quality audio and multiple input sources
              which work great for switching between laptop and PC

          <ul>
            <li>
              Picked this up as a pretty cheap upgrade from the built-in

              Paired with the{" "}

          <ul>
            <li>
              Again a cheap upgrade to cover a large portion of the desk as I
              tend to move the mouse and keyboard around a lot
