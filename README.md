# Hi, I'm Jon

I'm a Web Developer who specializes in interactive web applications with a passion for creating delightful user experiences. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and various web technologies.

I try to keep things light and easy by not relying too much on fancy graphics, animations or interactivity in my corner of the web. This speaks to what I find frustrating with a lot of modern sites that have to be constantly sharing content, showing adverts and otherwise bombarding your senses in the pursuit of clicks, impressions and money.

Most recently I've worked on large-scale front-end applications using React with a variety of supporting technologies such as Typescript, Redux, NextJS, Jest and Cypress while putting the user first by ensuring responsive and accessible websites were the default.
